# Multi-threaded Ray Tracer

A high-performance Ray Tracer built using **C++20 Coroutines** and a custom **Thread Pool**.

## Overview
This project demonstrates advanced C++ skills by combining **Computer Graphics** with **System-level Concurrency**.
- **Rendering**: Calculates light rays for a 3D scene (spheres, shadows).
- **Concurrency**: Uses a custom `Task Scheduler` to render scanlines in parallel across all available CPU cores.
- **Modern C++**: Utilizes C++20 `co_await`, `std::jthread` (or `std::thread`), and concepts.

## How It Works
1. **Math Library**: Custom `vec3`, `ray`, and `sphere` classes handle the 3D geometry.
2. **Task Scheduler**: A thread pool executes tasks asynchronously.
3. **Parallel Rendering**:
   - The image is split into scanlines.
   - Each scanline is a **Coroutine** (`Task`).
   - `co_await schedule(pool)` offloads the rendering of that scanline to a worker thread.

## Sample Output
Here is the result generated by the ray tracer:

*(This image was rendered in parallel using the custom Task Scheduler)*

## Installation and Execution

Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- **C++ Compiler**: You need a compiler that supports C++20.
    - **macOS**: Install Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`) or use Homebrew (`brew install llvm`).
    - **Linux**: `sudo apt install g++-10` (or newer).
    - **Windows**: Visual Studio 2019+ or MinGW with GCC 10+.

### Steps
1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    https://github.com/manideepUNB/Demo-Project.git
    cd Demo-Project
    ```

2.  **Compile the Code**:
    Run the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    clang++ -std=c++20 -pthread -o ray_tracer main.cpp
    ```
    *(Note: If using GCC, replace `clang++` with `g++`)*

3.  **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    ./ray_tracer
    ```
    You will see output indicating the rendering progress:
    ```text
    Rendering 400x225 image...
    Done! Saved to image.ppm
    ```

4.  **View the Result**:
    The program creates a file named `image.ppm`.
    - **macOS**: Run `open image.ppm`
    - **Linux**: Run `xdg-open image.ppm`
    - **Windows**: Open with GIMP or an online viewer.

## Performance
By using a Thread Pool, this ray tracer utilizes 100% of your CPU cores, rendering significantly faster than a single-threaded implementation.
